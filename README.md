# RF-Blaster

Code for a ESP8266 (NodeMCU) based 433MHz RF code sender and receiver.
I recommend to use a WL101-341 board, powered by 5V avoid range issues.
NOTE: after 12 months the sender module died. I now use 3.3V for the second module :)

I use it to control RF power outlets and light switches over http via Amazons Alexa using ha-bridge.


Make sure to change the config on top of each file.
